    "The proposed project is for the simulation and optimization of number of trains and passengers travelling on HS2 line from London to Birmingham using python. This project can help government in finalizing decision on the number of trains running per hour. First a simulation of the London-Birmingham section is designed using simpy library under assumptions of 14 signalling blocks and 9 number of trains running per hour. Then optimization techniques are used to minimize the number of signalling blocks and maximize the number of trains running per hour. The project is divided in different sections and each section describes a different phase of the project.  "

In this method average travelling time for passenger is minimized. As average trvelling time includes waiting time for next train and actual travelling time between two stations. So, a objective function is defined which consist of average traveling time, average waiting time and dwell time. Then different values generated using monte_carlo() function based on probability distribution is checked against the objective function to get minimized average traveling time. "

    "The project has successfully implemented simulation and optimization of London to Birmingham HS2 line. The simulation was developed by assuming the number of trains, number of signalling blocks and type of trains. The output of simulation was not optimized. So, optimization techniques are used in the project to get optimal output from the simulation. The monte-carlo optimization techniques maximized the number of trains and minimized the average travelling time. Customized optimization method has maximized the throughput of passengers travelling on HS2 line. Finally, 10 trains can travel on HS2 line in an hour and approximately 4410 max passenger can travel using this trains. Now, it will get easy for the government to make decision on number of trains running on HS2 line based on the proposed project."
